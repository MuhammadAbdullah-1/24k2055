ALGORITHM
Task 1:
Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an nth
Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6). 
If so, determine if itâ€™s an even number or odd number as well.

1.User entered Nth number as aN.
2.User entered nth number as an.
3.If (an mod aN = 0) then Display aN is a divisor of an.
4.Else Display aN is not a divisor of an.
5.Then set Quotient as (an/aN).
6.If (Quotient mod 2 = 0) then Display Quotient is Even.
7.Else Display Quotient is Odd.
